We describe in this document the minimal steps that you need to perform in order 
to contribute to an open source software.

## Fork the repository

You need to `fork` the original repository in your space. 
This operation creates a new repository in your space with the same name as the original one.
The created repository has a `children/parent` relation with the forked repository.

## Work with the forked repository

Checkout the forked repository and work on it.
You need to checkout and work on the forked repository in order to produce your contribution.
Work in your repository, commit, add and remove files, push as many times you want up to the
final solution was produced.

## Open an issue

In general any contribution could be difficult to understand, from the creator side.
In general a good practice is to open an issue or a feature request to explain the problem you had 
(before your contribution) or the feature you request for your work

## Open a pull request

Finally you can open a pull request referring in the comment the issue opened.
